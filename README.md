### Project Description
PinkMentor is a mentorship platform designed to connect learners with experienced mentors for structured guidance, career growth, and skill development. The platform enables users to register, explore mentorship opportunities, track progress, and build meaningful learning relationships in an organized and scalable way.

### The Problem statement
Many students and early professionals struggle to find consistent and structured mentorship. Even when mentorship exists, it often lacks:

- Clear goal tracking  
- Progress monitoring  
- Organized session scheduling  
- Centralized communication  

As a result, mentorship becomes informal, inconsistent, and ineffective

### The Solution
PinkMentor provides:

- Role-based authentication (Mentor / Mentee)
- Structured goal creation and tracking
- Session scheduling system
- Dashboard with progress insights
- Centralized mentorship records

By combining these features, PinkMentor transforms mentorship into a trackable and organized growth system.
